## Requirements

Before this module can be used on a project, you must ensure that the following pre-requisites are fulfilled:

1. Terraform are [installed](#software-dependencies) on the machine where Terraform is executed.
2. The Nifcloud Account you execute the module with has the right permissions.
    - You can set environment variable `NIFCLOUD_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `NIFCLOUD_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

## Usage

There are examples included in the examples folder but simple usage is as follows:

```hcl
# Provider
provider "nifcloud" {
  region = "jp-west-1"
}

# Module
module "minimum_k8s_cluster" {
  source  = "ystkfujii/minimum-k8s-cluster/nifcloud"

  availability_zone = "west-11"

  instance_key_name = "deployerkey"
}
```

Then perform the following commands on the root folder:

- `terraform init` to get the plugins
- `terraform plan` to see the infrastructure plan
- `terraform apply` to apply the infrastructure build
- `terraform destroy` to destroy the built infrastructure
